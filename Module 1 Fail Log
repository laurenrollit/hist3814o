Module 1 Fail log up until the cloning exercise:
I have completed the exercises of Module 1 from "Learning Markdown Syntax from dillinger.io" to the majority of "A detailed look at using git on the command line". Along the way, I was able to create files using Markdown tools and using the DH history box. I also became a little more familiar with code, connecting the command line of my DH box to the repository on GitHub. 
Through GitHub, I am attempting to make my notes open on the web. While my work from this week is not necessarily groundbreaking, it is useful to be able to learn these skills so that I can share later historical work with other scholars. The focus of the course this week is on "Open Access" history, and making research accessible for others, so I'm excited to develop new techniques for making my work more generous.
While the module was interesting, I came across a number of challenges in the process. For one, using the DH box was very difficult for me. I kept messing up the code, and I initially found both the instructions and the explanation of the process very confusing. For the majority of the week, until I figured it out, I was typing the code instructions having no idea how they were supposed to work. Because of this, I came across a lot of "fatal errors", especially trying to get my work onto the repository on GitHub. Eventually--although I'm not sure if this is correct--I just ended up saving copies of files onto the File Manager and uploading them on to Github.
I also had a particular problem creating new branches, because I didn't realize that each commit had an identifying chain of numbers. 
It was very frustrating for me to try to get used to these new mediums, and as someone not very tech-savvy, I found myself getting angry and often having to put the computer away. I'm hoping that I can be a little less frustrated and more forgiving in the weeks to come.
