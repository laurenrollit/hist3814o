On Tim Hitchcock's article "Big Data for Dead People", Shannon [commented](https://hyp.is/fsMA-FTCEeiVHN__hhcaWA/historyonics.blogspot.com/2013/12/big-data-for-dead-people-digital.html) that "often with the humanities, I find we become so engrossed in the textual that we forget the material world", adding that new experiences of the material world can make us more tolerant. I thought that this was a really interesting take: my experience of the humanities has been largely textual, especially in the Humanities "Great Books" program. While studying these texts has been engrossing and satisfying, I do wonder if I would be able to connect more to the humanities if I had not just been reading texts written by dead men.
For example, in [Hitchcock's article](https://historyonics.blogspot.ca/2013/12/big-data-for-dead-people-digital.html), the possibility of 3D scanning is discussed, in reference to the physical experiences of people from the past. Here, I think Shannon's use of the word "forget" is especially significant. While historians and archivists can preserve textual records, it is so much harder to preserve sounds and sensations. Because text is easy, I think we often forget that other aspects of the material are even a possibility in historical research. However, our dismissal of these other avenues seems unjustified. While 3D scanning is not yet available, sound is being explored in projects like [The Roaring Twenties](http://vectorsdev.usc.edu/NYCsound/777b.html), [The Virtual St. Paul's Cathedral Project](https://vpcp.chass.ncsu.edu/), and the [Beijing Sound History Project](https://blogs.wsj.com/chinarealtime/2013/11/15/museum-aims-to-capture-sights-and-sounds-of-old-beijing/).
I'm extremely interested in seeing how these projects change the study of digital humanities, and if--as Shannon mentioned--they make us more tolerant of diverse historical experiences. While I hadn't initially thought of sound/touch in history being used to encourage empathy, the suggestion makes a lot of sense to me. What better tactic to put ourselves in others' shoes, than to think about the physical experience of being in those shoes?
