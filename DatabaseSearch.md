In the Commonwealth War Graves Commission database, I searched my last name, "Rollit". I didn't find any results, which is what I was expecting: it's an uncommon surname, and the family members that I do know served in World War I and World War II survived them (although for my grandfather, this was narrowly, as he got injured by shrapnel on the Italian front and spent most of the war in the hospital with a shattered hip). 
So, I instead searched up a variation of my last name, "Rollitt": https://www.cwgc.org/find/find-war-dead/results?lastName=Rollitt.
With that, I found four results for British soldiers. I was surprised to discover that at least three of these soldiers were, in fact, also my relatives--I was able to recognize the names of their parents from portraits that hang in my parents' house.
To save the information for later, I downloaded the information onto my computer in an Excel file format.

In the case of the Epigraphic Database Heidelberg, I do not know any Latin. I tried searching up what Google told me were the Latin words for "butcher" and "shoemaker", but I didn't receive any results.
I then tried searching "figlina", which I learned was a Latin word for pottery: http://edh-www.adw.uni-heidelberg.de/inschrift/suche?hd_nr=&land=&fo_antik=&fo_modern_fundstelle=&literatur=&dat_jahr_a=&dat_jahr_e=&hist_periode=&atext1=figlina&bool=AND&atext2=&sort=hd_nr&anzahl=20.
I received 31 inscriptions as results, from locations ranging from Portugal to Bulgaria. 
I saved the information on my computer as an Excel file.
