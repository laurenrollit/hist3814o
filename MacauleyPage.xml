<p> <interp key="This claim is likely true, because the text was published in 1823. In 1826 the laws were changed to allow some Christian slaves to testify, as long as the white perpetrator was not subject to the death penalty" n="An act to regulate the admission of the Evidence of Slaves, in 73 BRITISH PARLIAMENTARY PAPERS: SLAVE TRADE 39-40 (Irish University Press 1969) (1826)" ref="https://scholarship.kentlaw.iit.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2907&context=cklawreview">3. In <placeName key="Jamiaca" ref=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaica">Jamaica</placeName> and the other islands the evidence of slaves is still wholly inadmissable, not merely in cases implicating their owner, but in all cases whatsoever, whether civil or criminal, affecting persons of free condition.</interp> <p>
<p> --Any White man may inflict not only thirty nine but three hundred and ninety lashes on a slave; he may even murder the slave outright; yet, if the crime be not commited in the presence of other persons of free condition willing to testify against him, he is secure from punishment. A thousand other slaves may have been present, but not one of the thousand would be permitted to offer his testimony in a court of justice against the criminal.

It is equally so in all civil causes, even when the suit involves a question of personal freedom.<p>
<p> It is unnecessary to point out the enormities which must result from such a system. About 345,000 inhabitants of <placeName key="Jamaica" ref="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaica">Jamaica<placeName>, for example, are thus shut out, by the operation of this universal principle of colonial law, from any fair hope of obtaining legal redress for any injury, whether civil or criminal, which they may sustain from any one of the privileged order, amounting, perhaps, to a fifteenth or twentieth part of the whole population; while the persons composing that order have this farther pledge of immunity, that is their common interest to discourage and defeat any attempts, on the part of the slaves, to obtain the efficient protection of magistrates or of courts of justice.<p>
The slaves in <placeName key="Jamaica" ref="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaica">Jamaica<placeName> and other colonies are still regarded by the law, and treated, in point of fact, not as human beings, but as chattels; and, as such, are liable to be seized and sold for the debts of their master, with as little <p>
